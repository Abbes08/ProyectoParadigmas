Discussion and ideas and proposal to create a new Haskell benchmark suite.


To compile the lhs into pdf, you can use the Makefile. For this, you should
have lhs2TeX installed, which you can obtain via cabal install lhs2tex. Beware
that it does require privileges to install several files into your tex
distribution. If you use sudo it will fubar the ownership on the files
installed in your .cabal directory. Hence, you should chown these, as well as
add read permissions to all the files that were installed into the tex
distribution directory.
